# roundcube_caldav_scheduling
Modified version of Kolab caldav plugin

The main reason for getting this code done, was to be able to use a caldav client for recent versions of Roundcube, which supported too event scheduling. It discovers too new calendars you create (just your own ones... not the ones you get permission to access from other users).
